# Project tracker
<br> A single-page application that helps you track the progress of your projects. It's written in React with the usage of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Styled Components. It features adding multiple projects, and freely switching between them. Users can personalize every project by setting: Title, description, and background image. You can measure time spent on particular projects, as well as manage tasks that you have to perform. All data that is necessary is stored in local storage. <br><br>
